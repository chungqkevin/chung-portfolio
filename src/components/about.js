      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for viewing my portfolio. I'm Kevin Chung, a Developer and Project Manager with a background in computer science, data analytics, and fashion specific e-commerce.
        <br /><br />
        Throughout my career, I have worn several hats, from building web applications and search engine optimizations to cultivating relationships with designers and producing collaborative projects.
        <br /><br />
        At Blue Owl, I led a variety of technical projects from concept to deployment, which you will find detailed in my works section below. My diverse tech stack, combined with my education in CS/Data Analytics, has equipped me to make strategic decisions based on facts and metrics.
        <br /><br />
        I am truly passionate about life-long learning. As an engineer learning new-technologies has always excited me as I strive to better my craft everyday. The ability to learn in both life and work has proven to keep me grounded in every step I take.
        <br /><br />
        In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my cat Miso and dog Gamja, as well as shooting both hoops and photos.
        <br /><br />
        I am currently open to new opportunities, whether they are tech or fashion-aligned.
        <br /><br />
        Let's connect and innovate together!
